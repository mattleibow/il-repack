    <description>ILRepack is meant at replacing ILMerge / Mono.Merge. 
The former being closed-source, impossible to customize, slow, resource consuming and many more. The later being deprecated, unsupported, and based on an old version of Mono.Cecil.

This package provides a library, for use within tools/build projects. 
If you need the tool as an executable, this is not the package you're looking for, this one is: http://www.nuget.org/packages/ILRepack/.</description>
    <summary>ILRepack is a utility that can be used to merge multiple .NET assemblies into a single assembly (packaged as a library).</summary>
